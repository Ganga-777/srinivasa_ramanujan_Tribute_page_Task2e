                Srinivasa Ramanujan, born on December 22, 1887, in Erode, Tamil Nadu, was a mathematical genius who made significant contributions to the field of number theory.

                What I truly adore about Ramanujan is his ability to intuitively discover profound mathematical truths. Despite facing many challenges and limited formal training, he produced theorems that continue to inspire mathematicians today.

            <p>
                Ramanujan's work on modular forms, mock theta functions, and his famous Ramanujan-Hardy number 1729, known as the Hardy-Ramanujan number, showcase the depth of his mathematical insight.

                The symbolism of a laptop with a browser icon might seem out of place for a mathematician from the early 20th century, but it represents the idea that Ramanujan's legacy lives on in the digital age, inspiring new generations of mathematicians who explore his theorems and build upon his work.
